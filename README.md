# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

## Project Overview
Adey Innovations Inc. aims to improve fraud detection for e-commerce and banking transactions using data-driven and machine learning techniques.  
This project focuses on building accurate, explainable, and robust fraud detection models while addressing challenges such as severe class imbalance and real-world transaction behavior.

## Business Problem
Fraud detection systems must balance two competing risks:

- **False Positives** – Legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud, harming user experience
- **False Negatives** – Fraudulent transactions that go undetected, leading to financial loss

This project emphasizes:
- Precision–Recall trade-offs
- Business-aware model evaluation
- Model explainability

## Datasets
The following datasets are used:

- **Fraud_Data.csv**  
  E-commerce transaction data including user behavior, device, timing, and transaction details.

- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**  
  Maps IP address ranges to countries for geolocation analysis.

- **creditcard.csv**  
  Bank transaction data with anonymized PCA-transformed features (used in later tasks).
